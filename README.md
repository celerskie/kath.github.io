            <h2>Dear Kath,</h2>
            <p>
                I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now. Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat. You are the most amazing person I've ever met, and I can't keep these feelings to myself any longer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I admire your kindness towards others and I feel so lucky to know you. I hope this doesn't come as a shock, but I really like you, and I would love to get to know you better.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter what your response is, I just wanted you to know how I feel. Thank you for being you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sincerely,<br>
                Admirer from afar
